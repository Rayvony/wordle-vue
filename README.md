This project is basically a wordle clone using vue + typescript, using your computer date it will generate a 5 letter word from an Array of possible words you could also create a custom 5 letter word by using a query with base64 enconding 
(here's a handy website to encode them https://www.base64encode.org/)
for example: http://localhost:5173/?cmVtaXg=
you can write the words using the buttons or your keyboard and you can also change from dark-theme to light-theme and vice versa
